ckanext-s3filestore
===================

.. Put a description of your extension here:

Use Amazon S3 or Minio<https://minio.io/> as a filestore for resources.


------------
Requirements
------------

Requires CKAN 2.7+

GitHub Actions tested: 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10


------------
Installation
------------

.. Add any additional install steps to the list below.
   For example installing any non-Python dependencies or adding any required
   config settings.

To install ckanext-s3filestore:

1. Activate your CKAN virtual environment, for example::

     . /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate

2. Install the ckanext-s3filestore Python package into your virtual environment::

     pip install ckanext-s3filestore

3. Add ``s3filestore`` to the ``ckan.plugins`` setting in your CKAN
   config file (by default the config file is located at
   ``/etc/ckan/default/production.ini``).

4. Restart CKAN. For example if you've deployed CKAN with Apache on Ubuntu::

     sudo service apache2 reload


---------------
Config Settings
---------------

Required::

    ckanext.s3filestore.aws_bucket_name = a-bucket-to-store-your-stuff
    ckanext.s3filestore.region_name = region-name
    ckanext.s3filestore.signature_version = s3v4

Conditional::

    ckanext.s3filestore.aws_access_key_id = Your-Access-Key-ID
    ckanext.s3filestore.aws_secret_access_key = Your-Secret-Access-Key

    Or:

    ckanext.s3filestore.aws_use_ami_role = true

Optional::

    # An optional path to prepend to keys
    ckanext.s3filestore.aws_storage_path = my-site-name

    # An optional setting to fallback to filesystem for downloads
    ckanext.s3filestore.filesystem_download_fallback = true
    # The ckan storage path option must also be set correctly for the fallback to work
    ckan.storage_path = path/to/storage/directory

    # An optional setting to change the ACL of the uploaded files.
    # Default 'public-read'.
    ckanext.s3filestore.acl = private

    # An optional setting to change the ACL of files previously uploaded
    # for the resource under different names.
    # 'auto' means use the same visibility as the current version.
    # Default 'private'.
    ckanext.s3filestore.non_current_acl = auto

    # An optional setting to control whether the ACLs of uploaded files
    # are updated immediately when the dataset is updated, or queued
    # for asynchronous processing. Defaults to True (ie asynchronous).
    # NB Inline updates occur during the same transaction as the dataset update,
    # and may cause significant overhead for datasets with many resources.
    ckanext.s3filestore.acl.async_update = False

    # An optional setting to specify which addressing style to use.
    # This controls whether the bucket name is in the hostname or is
    # part of the URL path. Options are 'path', 'virtual', and 'auto';
    # default is 'auto'.
    ckanext.s3filestore.addressing_style = path

    # Set this parameter only if you want to use a provider like Minio
    # as a filestore service instead of S3.
    # Ignored when using virtual addressing.
    ckanext.s3filestore.host_name = http://minio-service.com

    # To use user provided filepath and not use internal url basename
    # on download. This affects behaviour when using a URL that points
    # to an earlier version of a resource, with a different file name.
    # If True, the older file will be served.
    # If False, the newest file will be served (similarly to the default
    # CKAN filestore behaviour), but the older file will be available at
    # /dataset/{id}/resource/{resource_id}/orig_download/{filename}
    # Defaults to False.
    ckanext.s3filestore.use_filename = True

    # To mask the S3 endpoint with your own domain/endpoint when serving URLs to end users.
    # This endpoint should be capable of serving S3 objects as if it were an actual bucket.
    # The real S3 endpoint will still be used for uploading files.
    ckanext.s3filestore.download_proxy = https://example.com/my-bucket/

    # Cache control for signed URLs. Values are in seconds.
    # 'signed_url_expiry': How long a URL is valid (default 1 hour).
    # 'signed_url_cache_window': How long a URL will be reused,
    # if the resource is not updated in the meantime (default 30 min).
    # The expiry should be longer than the window (not equal);
    # otherwise, a URL may expire before a new one is available.
    # If either value is zero or negative, then URL caching is disabled.
    # 'public_url_cache_window': How long a public (unsigned) URL will be reused.
    ckanext.s3filestore.signed_url_expiry = 3600
    ckanext.s3filestore.signed_url_cache_window = 1800
    ckanext.s3filestore.public_url_cache_window = 86400

    # Control how long the ACL of an S3 object will be held in cache.
    # Uploading a new file overrides this. Default is 86400 (24 hours).
    ckanext.s3filestore.acl_cache_window = 2592000

    # If set, then prior objects uploaded not matching current filename for a
    #  resource may be deleted after the specified number of days from uploaded date.
    # If less than zero, nothing is deleted. Defaults to -1.
    #
    # I.e. delete_non_current_days is set to 90 days
    #  If resource was uploaded 91 days ago, it will be marked for deletion
    #  If resource was uploaded 10 days ago, it will be deleted after 80 days time
    #    until next job on dataset/resource is run.
    #
    # Note: If S3 Versioning is enabled, then file can be recovered per external policy.
    #          Similar to same filename being used.
    #       If S3 Versioning is not enabled, then file is not recoverable.
    ckanext.s3filestore.delete_non_current_days = 90

    # Queue used by s3 plugin, if not set, `default` queue is used
    ckanext.s3filestore.queue = bulk


-----------------
CLI
-----------------

Registering ckanext-s3filestore on PyPI
---------------------------------------

ckanext-s3filestore should be available on PyPI as
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ckanext-s3filestore. If that link doesn't work, then
you can register the project on PyPI for the first time by following these
steps:

1. Create a source distribution of the project::

     python setup.py sdist

2. Register the project::

     python setup.py register

3. Upload the source distribution to PyPI::

     python setup.py sdist upload

4. Tag the first release of the project on GitHub with the version number from
   the ``setup.py`` file. For example if the version number in ``setup.py`` is
   0.0.1 then do::

       git tag 0.0.1
       git push --tags


----------------------------------------------
Releasing a New Version of ckanext-s3filestore
----------------------------------------------

ckanext-s3filestore is available on PyPI as https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ckanext-s3filestore.
To publish a new version to PyPI follow these steps:

1. Update the version number in the ``setup.py`` file.
   See `PEP 440 <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#public-version-identifiers>`_
   for how to choose version numbers.

2. Create a source distribution of the new version::

     python setup.py sdist

3. Upload the source distribution to PyPI::

     python setup.py sdist upload

4. Tag the new release of the project on GitHub with the version number from
   the ``setup.py`` file. For example if the version number in ``setup.py`` is
   0.0.2 then do::

       git tag 0.0.2
       git push --tags
